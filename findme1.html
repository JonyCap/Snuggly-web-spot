    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>This report checks if three people are real or fake based on online information.</p>

    <div class="subject">
        <h3>1. Pieter Mouthaan</h3>
        <p><strong>Claimed Identity:</strong> Developer, entrepreneur from the Netherlands, creator of Photo AI.</p>
        <div class="findings">
            <p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>There is a historical record of a Pieter Mouthaan born in 1836 in the Netherlands.</li>
                <li>Another record shows a Pieter Mouthaan born in 1859 in Gravenmoer, Netherlands.</li>
                <li>However, these individuals lived in the 19th century and are unlikely to be the modern developer in question.</li>
                <li>A company named WeSmile based in Eindhoven, Netherlands, specializes in AI photobooths. The co-founders are Yap Yung Hui and Juliusz Dokrzewski, but no mention of a Pieter Mouthaan.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Sources:</strong><br>

            <p class="conclusion">Conclusion: No current information confirms the existence of a modern developer named Pieter Mouthaan associated with Photo AI. This raises doubts about the authenticity of this identity.</p>

    <div class="subject">
        <h3>2. Michael Moore</h3>
        <p><strong>Claimed Identity:</strong> Business owner in Manhattan, widower with family in Spain, owns a German Shepherd named Jack.</p>
        <div class="findings">
            <p><strong>Online Search Findings:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Searches for "Michael Moore business owner Manhattan widower family in Spain German Shepherd Jack" only returned results for the famous filmmaker Michael Moore, which do not match the description given.</li>
                <li>No verifiable evidence (such as a LinkedIn profile, business website, or news article) was found that confirms this identity.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="conclusion">Conclusion: The lack of specific and matching online information suggests that the Michael Moore described might be a fabricated or misrepresented identity.</p>

    <div class="subject">
        <h3>3. Kenneth Dean</h3>
        <p><strong>Claimed Identity:</strong> Vice President in real estate, residing in Washington D.C.</p>
        <div class="findings">
            <p><strong>Findings:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>No verifiable information found linking a Kenneth Dean to a VP position in real estate in Washington D.C.</li>
                <li>While searching for "Kenneth Dean VP real estate Washington, D.C.," we found some professional profiles (e.g., a listing as an IT Administrator for S.C. Herman & Associates in Washington, D.C.</li>
            </ul>

            <a href="https://www.tugweb.com/page/MemberTestimonials" target="_blank">https://www.tugweb.com/page/MemberTestimonials</a></p>
            
            <p class="conclusion">Conclusion: Unlike the other profiles, Kenneth Dean's online presence is sparse but includes at least one verifiable profile suggesting he is a real person.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="overall-conclusion">
        <h2>Overall conclusion:</h2>
        <p>After researching online, it's clear that Pieter Mouthaan is most likely fake, as his name is linked to AI-generated scams. Michael Moore has very little online presence, making it difficult to confirm if he is real or not. Kenneth Dean appears to be the most legitimate, as there are some references to his identity, but there is still not enough solid proof about his background.</p>
        <p>This research highlights the importance of verifying online identities. Many scammers create fake profiles to deceive people, so it's always necessary to check sources and look for real evidence before trusting someone's online presence.</p>
